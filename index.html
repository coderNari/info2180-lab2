                        this original
                        cheesecake recipe with our step by step recipe of how to bake a cheesecake in a water bath.
                        <br>
                        <br>I like to think that I am making up for lost cheesecake time. When I was little I didn't like
                        cheesecake because I thought there was actual cheese inside and I didn't like cheese, which is 
                        a shocker because I thought all kids LOVED cheese.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are quite a few cheesecake recipes on our blog, but there hasn't been a classic cheesecake
                        recipe until now! Granted, I like my cheesecake loaded with extra stuff and flavors, but I am totally 
                        okay with plain cheesecake if it's covered in chocolate.
                        <br>
                        <br> Here is our classic plain cheesecake recipe. We're giving you all the tips so it turns out
                        perfectly!
                     </p>
                     <h3> How to Make Graham Cracker Crust for Cheesecake </h3>
                     <p>
                        4 ingredients graham cracker crust
                        <br>
                        <br>graham cracker crumbs: did you know you can buy a box of graham cracker crumbs in the baking aisle
                        of your grocery store? They are usually near the pre-made graham cracker pie crusts. I love using
                        the store bought graham cracker crumbs because it saves times!
                        <br>
                        <br>brown sugar: adds a deep rich flavor to the crust and helps to bind the crumbs and butter together
                        <br>
                        <br>cinnamon: adds a little warmth and spice without being overwhelming
                        <br>
                        <br>butter: this most crucial ingredient in binding the crust together 
                        <br>
                        <br> Mix all the crust ingredients together and then firmly press the crust into the bottom and up the
                        sides of a springform pan.
                        <br>
                        <br>Use the bottom of a measuring cup or bottom of a glass cup to help pack the crust.
                     </p>

                        Our classic cheesecake recipe only calls for 4 ingredients! 
                        <br>
                        <br>cream cheese: use three 8 oz packages. Be sure to use full fat, not low fat, cream cheese for best
                        results. 
                        <br>
                        <br>sugar: helps to balance the tanginess of the cream cheese.
                        <br>
                        <br>vanilla extract: just a teaspoon, but it enhances the flavor.
                        <br>
                        <br>eggs: eggs are the last ingredient that get mixed into the cheesecake batter. Be sure to mix them
                        in, one at a time, just until the yolk breaks. Over beating the eggs is the number one cause of air
                        bubbles and cracking.

                     <p>
                        <br>Every single cheesecake recipe I have on my site, I include two critical tips. Here are the 2 most
                        important details to follow when making cheesecake.. 
                        <br>
                        <br>1. Don't be afraid of the water bath
                        <br>
                        <br>2. Don't rush the cooling process
                        <br>
                        <br>Keep reading below for details on each tip! 
                     </p>
                     <h3>How to Make a Cheesecake Water Bath </h3>
                     <p> I know it sounds weird, putting your cheesecake in a water bath, but it's the secret to creating
                        moist, perfectly baked cheesecake. It's really not scary. 
                        <br>
                        <br>The basics of a water bath: Place a springform pan inside a large cake or roasting pan, fill the
                        roasting pan with about 1 inch of water and place in the oven. 
                     </p>
                     <h3>How to Prevent your Cheesecake Water Bath from Leaking</h3>
                     <p>This is the best trick ever to prevent your cheesecake water bath from leaking and ruining your
                        cheesecake.
                        <br>
                        <br>Place the springform pan inside a large oven safe turkey bag or slow cooker liner bag and roll down
                        the top of the bag so it doesn't cover the cheesecake. If you have a lot of excess bag space, twist
                        one side tight and knot it so the bag is tight around the pan. Place the springform pan that's
                        inside the bag in the large roasting pan and fill with water.
                        <br>
                        <br>The water bath will not leak into your cheesecake!
                     <h3> How to Cool Cheesecake</h3>
                     <p> Remember, don't rush the cooling process.
                        <br>
                        <br>Once the cheesecake is done baking turn the oven off and gently remove the springform pan from the
                        water bath and oven safe bag. Place the cheesecake on a baking sheet and return to the oven (oven is
                        off) with the oven door cracked.
                        <br>
                        <br>A slow cooling process will help prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Don't forget to refrigerate
                        your cheesecake over night before serving.

               <h2> The Secrets to Thin Crust Pizza</h2>
               <h4> May 12, 2022 by Peggy Paul Casella </h4>
                <br>
                <br> <img id="imgBlog" src="pizza.png" alt="Flat Crust Pizza" style="height:150px;" ALIGN="LEFT">
               <br>
               <br>1.	Skip the rising time. The fermentation process, also known as the rise, allows yeast to digest the sugars in the flour and produce carbon dioxide and ethanol,
               which make the dough ball puff up and result in the fluffy consistency we all love in loaves of bread and Neapolitan pizza crust.
               So, if you want your pizza crust to be nice and thin, your best bet is to give the dough as little fermentation time as possible. 
               In my thin crust pizza dough recipe, I opt for 15 to 30 minutes of resting time; feel free to play around with more or less time depending on your taste and schedule.
               <br>
               <br>2.	Roll it out. A rolling pin makes easy work of morphing a ball of dough into a super-thin, pizza-size round. Plus, it also smooshes out any bubbles that might form during baking. 
               <br>
               <br>3.	Bake it on a dark metal pan or hot baking stone/steel. Dark metal transfers heat more efficiently than light metal does, so if you're using a baking sheet or pizza pan, 
               choose the darkest one you have. That being said, if you like your thin crust pizza extra crispy, use a preheated baking stone or steel.
               <h3>How to Make Thin Crust Pizza Dough</h3>
               <p>Time needed: 45 minutes. 
               <br>
               <br>This dough is one of the easiest and quickest ones to whip up. Here are the step-by-step directions, complete with handy tips that will help you bake up perfect pizzas every time:
               <br>
               <br>1.	Preheat the oven (if you're making the pizzas right away). </br>
               Since the dough only needs 15 to 30 minutes of resting time, I like to preheat my oven before I start the recipe. If you're using a baking stone or steel plate, put it on a rack in the bottom third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 500°F for at least 30 minutes.
               <br>
               <br>2.	Mix together flour, salt, yeast, water, and olive oil. 
               In a large mixing bowl, using a dough whisk or sturdy wooden spoon, mix together the bread or all-purpose flour, fine sea salt, and a packet of instant dry yeast. Then, add a cup of warm tap water and a tablespoon of oil. Mix with the dough whisk or wooden spoon until the dough comes together and most of the flour is incorporated.</br>
               <br>
               <br>3.	Knead the dough. 
               Take off your rings and plunge your fingers into the dough. Squish the dough through your fists, then flip it over and keep squishing until all the dry bits are fully incorporated. Next, dust a clean work surface with flour. Knead the dough on the floured surface for about 5 minutes, turning it frequently. You're done kneading when the dough slowly springs back when you poke it gently with your finger.
               <br>
               <br>4.	Let it rest. 
               Cover the dough with an upside-down bowl (I use the same one I mixed the dough in, to save dishes). Let the dough rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
               <br>
               <br>5.	Ball it up. 
               Divide the dough into 2 to 3 equal-size pieces. If you want to make smaller 10-inch pizzas or like cracker-thin pizza crust, go with 3 pieces. If you want to make 12- to 14-inch pizzas, go with 2 pieces. Form each piece of dough into a ball.
               <br>
               <br>6.	Roll out the pizza dough. 
               Work with one ball of dough at a time, keeping the other(s) under the upside-down bowl on your countertop so they don't dry out. Place the dough ball on a sheet of parchment paper, then top with another sheet of parchment. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough between the parchment to a 10- to 14-inch round, depending on the size of the dough ball and your desired thickness. The parchment prevents the dough from sticking to your rolling pin without the addition of extra flour, which can make the pizza crust too dry. If you like, you can also gently stretch the dough after you've rolled it out. Just resist the urge to add extra flour unless the dough is really sticky.
               <br>
               <br>7.	Top and bake! 
               Peel off the top layer of parchment paper, and transfer the dough (with the bottom piece of parchment under it) to your baking sheet or pizza pan. Or, if you're using a preheated baking stone or steel plate, peel off both pieces of parchment paper and transfer the thin crust pizza dough to a lightly floured pizza peel or upside-down baking sheet.
               Top the dough with your favorite sauce, cheese, and other toppings (ideas below). Then, transfer the topped dough to the oven and bake until the crust is golden around the edges and evenly browned on the bottom, about 8 minutes on a baking stone or steel, 10 to 15 minutes on a baking sheet or pizza pan.
               <h3>How to Store Thin Crust Pizza Dough for Later</h3>
               <p>Not planning to use all that dough? No problem! Mix the dough, knead it, let it rest, and ball it up. But instead of rolling out the thin crust pizza dough, place each ball in a separate airtight container or zip-top bag. Keep the dough in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
               When you're ready to use the dough, let it thaw completely (if frozen) and come to room temperature. Then, roll it out and top it according to the recipe below. Bake and enjoy!</p>
               <h3>Topping Tips</h3>
               <p>There are no rules when it comes to thin crust pizza toppings. However, I do have some pieces of advice:
               <br>
               <br>•	Scale back on sauce. Too much sauce can prevent your thin crust pizza from getting that crispy texture you're dreaming of. So, instead of pouring the sauce on by the cupful, start with about half a cup and add more from there. You always want to be able to see swipes of the naked dough through the sauce.
               <br>
               <br>•	Same deal with toppings. Instead of big hunks of cooked sausage, go for thinly sliced pepperoni. And instead of slabs of eggplant, think shaved Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, or spring onions. 
               <br>
               <br>•	Play with flavor pairings. Since the crust is thin and won't steal the show, this is a great opportunity to test out interesting combos. For example, why not camembert and red grapes; pear, blue cheese, and bacon; or sweet pepper, almond, and manchego?
